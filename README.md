# UC Davis Coding Bootcamp Challenge #1/Assignment #1


## Description

This project entailed updating the codebase of an existing webpage that had already been developed by our marketing agency.  I was asked to bring it up to accessiblity standards for search engine optimization and to also improve upon the code so that it would be better organized, consolidated and streamlined nicely for other developers in the future who might need to make updates to it.

In working on this project, I learned about the CSS box model, positioning, and various other things in regards to basic HTML elements and CSS stylings.
